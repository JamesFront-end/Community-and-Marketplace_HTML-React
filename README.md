Frontend:
For the modern and interactive interface you see:
Framework: I used React.js for the frontend development, ensuring a dynamic and responsive user experience.
State Management: I used Redux to manage global state, such as authentication, notifications and feed data.
Styling and Components: Styling was done using Tailwind CSS, which sped up development and maintained visual consistency of the design.
For more advanced components such as menus, modals and carousels, I used libraries such as Headless UI and Framer Motion (for smooth animations).
API Integration: Calls to the backend were made using Axios and RTK Query for greater performance and organization.

Backend:
The backend was developed to ensure scalability, security and high performance:
Programming Language: I used Node.js with the Express.js framework, due to its flexibility and compatibility with real-time applications.
Authentication: Implemented secure authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user sessions.
Integration with OAuth 2.0 allowed login via social networks such as Google, Facebook and Twitch.
Real-time Services: For features such as instant messaging and real-time notifications, I used Socket.io.
File Storage: User images and videos (e.g., avatars, uploads) were stored using AWS S3.
For image optimization, I implemented Cloudinary.
Testing: Created automated tests for REST endpoints with Jest and Supertest.

Database:
As mentioned before, I used:
PostgreSQL for relational and transactional data.
MongoDB for messages and unstructured data.
Redis as a cache to speed up frequent queries, such as profile data and friend lists. (VS code)
